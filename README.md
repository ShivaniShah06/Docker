# Docker
This repository contains common commands and important information related to docker.

## Some basic information on what docker is used for:

With docker, you can run each component of an application (webserver, database, messaging, orchestration) in a separate container with its own dependencies and its own libraries all on the same virtual machine and operating system but; within the separate environment or containers. We just have to build docker configuration once and developers can get started simply by running `docker run` command irrespective of what operating system they use. They just need docker installed on their system.

The main purpose of docker is to package and containerize apps, and to ship them, and to run them anytime, anywhere and as many times as you want.
